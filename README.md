## Rendering Lists In React
- It's best practice to use the key prop because it will help react render thing s more efficiently
  - For example, if an element is already rendered on the screen, react won't rerender it but without the key, react cannot be sure if it''s the same exact element
  - The keys need to be unique and it will make your app render more effectively when rendering lists.
